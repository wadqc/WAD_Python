    This method is based on the convolution of a scaled window with the signal.
    The signal is prepared by introducing reflected copies of the signal 
    (with the window size) in both ends so that transient parts are minimized
    in the begining and end part of the output signal.

    input:
        x: the input signal 
        window_len: the dimension of the smoothing window
        window: the type of window from 'flat', 'hanning', 'hamming', 'bartlett', 'blackman'
            flat window will produce a moving average smoothing.

    output:
        the smoothed signal

    example:

    import numpy as np    
    t = np.linspace(-2,2,0.1)
    x = np.sin(t)+np.random.randn(len(t))*0.1
    y = smooth(x)
